Triggers: How they work

JSON components have two primary fields that they use to manage triggers: CreationTrigger and Triggers
	CreationTriggers are loaded by the layer object as soon as it is instantiated
		More specifically, by the LayerManager
		They have two fields, TriggerType and either TriggerName or TriggerOrder
		TriggerType can be OnCalled or Ordered
			If OnCalled, they will have a TriggerName
			When a Trigger with that name is called, the layer that owns that Trigger will call loadOtherObject and instantiate each object that has a CreationTrigger with that TriggerName (in no particular order)
			If Ordered, they will have a TriggerOrder
			As the final step of layer instantiation, TriggerManager.resolveOrdered is called
			This walks through and resolves each Ordered trigger in... order, low to high
			If there are multiple Ordered triggers with the same TriggerOrder, they are resolved, once again, in no particular order
	Triggers are loaded by the MapComponent when it is loaded from the JSON component
		It consists of a dict of trigger names to triggers
		The triggers have a number of fields
		TriggerType is the only required one
			Right now, this only supports AfterCreation
			Generally speaking, these triggers will be called as the final step of instantiating a MapComponent
			Any OnCalled CreationTriggers with the same TriggerName will be executed
		Other fields:
			RepeatCount {int}: The trigger will be called this many times (minimum) instead of once
			ContinueFunction {str}: The name of the trigger_functions.TriggerThreshold class to use to determine when to cease calling the trigger
			StopThreshold {float}: The value ContinueFunction must return before the trigger stops being called
			ContinueArgs {dict}: Arguments to pass to ContinueFunction
			MaxCalls {int}: The maximum number of times the trigger may be called before it stops, regardless of ContinueFunction's value

		FunctionTriggers
			TriggeredFunction {str}: The name of the trigger_functions.TriggeredFunction class to call when the trigger is executed
			TriggeredFunctionArgs {dict}: Arguments to pass to TriggeredFunction
				Note that if a TriggeredFunction is defined, the name of the trigger is *usually* irrelevant
				Since, generally speaking, the point of the trigger will be to execute that function
				It's best practice to use a separate trigger to call other OnCalled triggers, for clarity's sake
					(Though sometimes this will not be best - Especially if ContinueFunction is defined, one might lose efficiency)
